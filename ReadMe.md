## ✨ Concept

Designed to break away from traditional static portfolios, this project treats the developer's profile as a high-end product launch. Inspired by Apple's keynotes and Awwwards-winning immersive experiences, it leverages **WebGL**, **smooth scrolling**, and **physics-based interactions** to create a seamless flow.

The goal? To evoke a "Wow" effect immediately upon entry.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with a focus on performance, fluidity, and modern web capabilities.
